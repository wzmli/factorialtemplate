#Simple instructions
- make (create combination.txt)
- make alljags/allnim (will make template, fit results, fit object)

First define folders and wildcards

model-filename is creating the file name with the pieces.
- Subst is substitute
- Not sure what **basename** and **notdir** means
- $(1), $(2), $(3) means substituting elements?

- Not sure about the model-template function
- model-template-filtered takes bugstemp.R **arguments** and run it
- ALLMODELS defined as all the created templates
- Running make forloops for making template and fitting

- Stop here! not sure how the pbs works
