# now we apply our rule generation template to all combinations
# of all factor dimensions: nested foreach loops, one level
# for each dimension, and an innermost invocation of template
# to each of loop variables
# n.b., it's important to do $(eval $(call ...))
# $(call ...) creates the appropriate string
# but $(eval ...) takes that string and includes it in the make definitions
# WARNING: THIS NEST LOOP IS PARSED EVERYTIME `make` IS INVOKED
# so for a factorial design that includes many, large dimensions, should prefer to
# have these rules built once (and rebuilt only when necessary), rather than dynamically
# for each `make ...` call.  Clever way to do that might be to have
# a to-be-included .mk file which is (re)built based on
# directory contents, then always included?

# one approach: have a pbs run for each component in the factorial design.
# upside: can have tailored resource requirements for runs
# downside: ...tailored resource requirements for runs (as in, user has to provide all of
# them individually).  however, we can just take a "defaults" approach and use make arguments to
# override them.
# another advantage to this approach: $PBS_ARRAYID is used w/ the sample #s
# this is really useful for looking up jobs: you have jobname which
# tells you factor combination + array id within job telling you sample id

# convention: use lowercase make variables to correspond to values we expect to sometimes
# override
